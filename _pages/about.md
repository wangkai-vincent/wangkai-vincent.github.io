<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Kai Wang (王凯), currently a Researcher at TeleAI, focusing on large-scale foundation model security and trustworthy AI. My research centers on building systematic defense mechanisms across the data, model, and applications of modern LLMs. My primary research interests include: Data Provenance, Attribution, and Backtracking; Self-Repairing Large Models & Robustness Enhancement; Personalized & Multi-value Defensive Alignment; Cross-Modal Safety Alignment; Safe Decoding & Risk-Aware Generation.

Before joining TeleAI, I served as a Senior Algorithm Expert at ByteDance and Kuaishou, where I led mission-critical projects such as Kuaishou KuaYi LLM Security and TikTok Shop Logistics Compliance. These systems handled hundreds of millions of requests per day, requiring millisecond-level latency, high-precision risk control, and resilience against continuously evolving adversarial behaviors. Through systematic model–data–rule co-design, the solutions I built achieved industry-leading safety performance and were deployed at global scale, enabling large-model technologies to operate reliably within high-stakes, real-world industrial ecosystems.

During my early career, I received multiple prestigious talent awards, including Huawei TopMinds (华为天才少年), Kuaishou “KuaiStar-X” (快手快Star), Tencent “Qingyun” (腾讯青云), and Meituan “Beidou” (美图北斗), and ACM Second Prize Award.
